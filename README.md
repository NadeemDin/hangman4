#Project: Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
The aim of this project is to revise and understand the complexities of OOP in Python. 
I  will also aim to add a visual of sorts to the game to make it more enjoyable, perhaps using turtle graphics or Tkinter.
